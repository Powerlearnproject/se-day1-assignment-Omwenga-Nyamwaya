# Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

Software engineering is field of a computer science involving engineering principles to design, develop or create, test and maintain software. This field focuses on coming up software programs in a goal for satification of user's needs which will enhance productivity or improve everday life. The importance of software engineering are that it ensures reliable, scalable, and efficient software. Manages complexity in large systems such banking or healthcare. Reduces risks of failures, security breaches, and cost overruns.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)

The approach to programming known as structured programming was developed by Edsger Dijkstra into a method that focused on logical design principles to simplify and enhance maintenance of code.

Emergence of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s-1990s)

OOP principles together with C++ and Java languages became the foundation for software development evolution by implementing modular structures, reusable code blocks and scalable design.

Agile Manifesto and Agile Development (2001)

Modern software development practices were deeply impacted by the introduction of Agile Manifesto principles that embraced flexibility as well as iterative development and customer-oriented collaboration.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

1. The initial phase consists of establishing project scope together with objectives as well as assessing feasibility.
2. Next is requirements analysis. In this phase we gather and document user and system requirements.
3. The design phase works towards creating system and architectural structures.
4. This phase, the code components go through a writing and integration process (Implementation - Coding).
5. Next phase is testing. The process of testing checks for operational correctness alongside system performance and protection functionality.
6. Deployment phase invlovle release the software to users.
7. The system maintenance stage includes software updates together with bug fixes and system improvements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

In Waterfall methodology projects advance through consecutive stages that need completion before starting following ones. For example this is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, such as government software systems.
While Agile represents a flexible process which makes room for endless iterations and lets stakeholders offer ongoing improvements. For example, they are dynamic projects like mobile app development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Sofware Developer develop application code by writing codes while ensuring program fixes and implementing new features.

The Quality Assurance Engineer automates testing processes while performing defect detection and maintaining quality standards through software tests.

As Project Manager the individual oversees administration of project scope alongside resource planning and deadline management.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs serve as Integrated Development Environments which give developers writing and debugging and testing tools such as Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA.

The Version Control System VCS (Version Control Systems) enables users to monitor alterations and handle team interactions while keeping a record of all changes through tools such as Git and GitHub.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Debugging and testing. To overcome we can use debugging tools as well, we can use automated testing tools.
2. Emerging new technology. We can overcome this challenge by continuous learning and professional development. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing – Tests individual components for correctness.

Integration Testing – The integration test ensures that combined components fully function together as one unit.

System Testing – Validates the complete system against requirements.

Acceptance Testing – The Acceptance Testing process confirms whether software systems satisfy the specified requirements of their end-users.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The practice of prompt engineering entails creating prompts that maximize the effectiveness of AI model interactions. AI models need prompt engineering to generate precise results which match the situation as well as the meaningful information needed by users.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of Improving a Prompt

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."

Improved Prompt: "Provide a summary of key events in World War II, including major battles and their outcomes."

Why the Improved Prompt is Better?

The specific prompt defines World War II as the topic while outlining major battles and their results which produces a knowledgeable answer.
